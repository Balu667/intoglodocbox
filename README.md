our current usecase has two types of users 
1.Admin 
2.User 
Follwing are the current featuers of admin
Primarly admin will create the Doc boxes can have delete and edit permissions for files in it, he can upload files
and delete files possible
So, these Dox box are of two types
1.Public Doc box: can have View only access for files in it to any users
2.Private Dox box: These type Doc box can be seen by any particular user when admin gives him access to it, unlike public doc box
where all user can View only files.
User featuters are as follows 
1.User can upload and delete files in Doc boxes assigned to him.
2.User cann't able to delete files uploaded by admin,he has only view only access 

In both cenarios wheather files upload by Admin and User they can give permissions based on start_date and End_date
